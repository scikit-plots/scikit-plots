Experimental submodules for Scikit-Plots.

This package contains optional or in-development modules that extend
Scikit-Plots functionality in areas such as customer lifetime analytics,
LLM-based components, and UI tooling. These modules are provided on an
experimental basis and may change or be removed in future releases.

Notes
-----
- These modules are not guaranteed to be stable.
- Importing them is optional; missing dependencies are handled gracefully.
- APIs may change without notice.
