"""
External dependencies vendored for stability and reproducibility for Scikit-Plots.

This package contains third-party Python modules that Scikit-Plots depends on for
plotting, statistics, array APIs, and numerical utilities. These modules are
bundled directly to ensure consistent behavior across different environments,
even when the original libraries are missing or version-incompatible.

Notes
-----
- These modules are *vendored*, meaning they are included in the source tree
  and isolated from system-wide installations.
- They are loaded only when required.
- Missing optional components are handled gracefully without raising import errors.

Vendored subpackages include (but are not limited to):
    _packaging        : Lightweight packaging utilities
    _probscale        : Probability scale transformations
    _scipy            : Minimal SciPy functionality for internal use
    _seaborn          : Core plotting extensions
    _sphinxext        : Sphinx documentation tools
    _tweedie          : Tweedie distribution helpers
    array_api_compat  : Compatibility layer for array API standards
    array_api_extra   : Extensions to array API compatibility
