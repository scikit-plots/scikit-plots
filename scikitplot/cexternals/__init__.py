C-External libraries vendored for high-performance extensions for Scikit-Plots.

This package contains optimized C/C++ and template-based libraries that are
bundled with Scikit-Plots to provide fast numerical, geometric, and algorithmic
capabilities used in advanced visualization and machine learning workflows.

These modules wrap native backends (e.g. Annoy, NumCpp, F2PY-generated code)
through Python extension interfaces to ensure consistent performance and
availability across environments, without relying on separate system installs.

Notes
-----
- All modules are optional and imported safely when available.
- Vendored code may be experimental or limited to internal use.
- APIs may change in future releases without deprecation warnings.

_astropy  : Astronomy utilities and array backends (vendored subset)
_f2py     : Fortran-Python interface support
_numcpp   : NumCpp C++ template array library
annoy     : Approximate nearest neighbor search implementation
