Multiplying and summing at once
---------------------------------

Some calculations require *multiplying* corresponding values and then *summing* the
products — a weighted average, a total from quantities and prices, a count across
multiple conditions. **SUMPRODUCT** does exactly this in one formula: it multiplies
corresponding elements of arrays and sums the results. It is a more advanced
spreadsheet tool, and a versatile one, extending the calculation toolkit beyond the
conditional aggregates.

How SUMPRODUCT works
----------------------

``SUMPRODUCT`` takes arrays (ranges) of equal size, multiplies them element by
element, and sums the products:

.. code-block:: text

   =SUMPRODUCT(quantity, price)

If ``quantity`` is {2, 5, 3} and ``price`` is {10, 4, 20}, this computes
(2×10) + (5×4) + (3×20) = 20 + 20 + 60 = 100 — the total revenue, in one formula,
without a helper column of row-by-row products. That is the core use: a sum of
products across two aligned columns.

Weighted averages and beyond
------------------------------

``SUMPRODUCT`` shines for weighted calculations. A weighted average — where each
value counts according to a weight — is a ``SUMPRODUCT`` divided by the sum of
weights:

.. code-block:: text

   = SUMPRODUCT(scores, weights) / SUM(weights)

This computes the average score weighted by importance, a calculation that is
awkward without ``SUMPRODUCT``. The function generalises the plain ``SUM`` of a
single column to a sum of *combinations* of columns.

Multi-condition counting with SUMPRODUCT
------------------------------------------

A powerful advanced use: ``SUMPRODUCT`` can count or sum across *multiple
conditions* by multiplying arrays of TRUE/FALSE tests (which evaluate as 1/0):

.. code-block:: text

   =SUMPRODUCT((region="North")*(amount>100))

Each condition produces an array of 1s and 0s; multiplying them gives 1 only where
*both* hold; summing counts the rows meeting both — a flexible alternative to
``COUNTIFS`` that can express conditions the plural functions cannot. This
array-logic capability is why ``SUMPRODUCT`` is a favourite of advanced spreadsheet
users.

The caveat
------------

``SUMPRODUCT``'s power comes with complexity and pitfalls. The arrays **must be the
same size** — mismatched ranges produce an error or, worse, a wrong result; and the
array-condition syntax (``(region="North")*(amount>100)``) is unintuitive until
learned, making the formulas hard for others to read. ``SUMPRODUCT`` can also be
slower on large ranges than purpose-built functions. Because it is powerful but
opaque, use it where its multiply-then-sum or multi-condition logic is genuinely
needed — a weighted average, a condition ``COUNTIFS`` cannot express — rather than
where a clearer ``SUMIF`` or ``COUNTIFS`` would do, and comment what a
``SUMPRODUCT`` formula computes. Clarity over cleverness applies. The next lesson
turns to the most powerful summarising tool of all: the pivot table.
