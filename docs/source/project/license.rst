scikit-plots only uses BSD compatible code, and its license is based on
the `PSF <https://docs.python.org/3/license.html>`_ license.  See the Open
Source Initiative `licenses page
<https://opensource.org/licenses>`_ for details on individual

Copyright policy
================

Reiichiro Nakano began scikit-plot around 2018. But,
as has always been the case, scikit-plot is the work of many.

Prior to Oct of 2024, and the 0.3.7 release, the copyright of the
source code was held by Reiichiro Nakano. As of Oct 2024, and the 0.3.7
release, scikit-plots has moved to a shared copyright model.

scikit-plots uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains
copyright over their contributions to scikit-plots. But, it is important to
note that these contributions are typically only changes to the
repositories. Thus, the scikit-plots source code, in its entirety, is not
the copyright of any single person or institution.  Instead, it is the
collective copyright of the entire scikit-plots Development Team.  If
individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should
indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when
they commit the change to one of the scikit-plots repositories.

The scikit-plots Development Team is the set of all contributors to the
scikit-plots project.  A full list can be obtained from the git version
control logs.
