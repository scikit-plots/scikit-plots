Do-Re-Mi
======================================================================

**doremi** is a modular Python library for musical note handling, sound synthesis, and notation processing.
It bridges music theory and audio programming by offering tools for pitch representation, waveform generation, solfÃ¨ge conversion, and more.

ðŸŽµ From notes to sound â€” all in Python.

Overview
--------

`doremi` supports both Western and solfÃ¨ge notation systems, and provides clean APIs for:

- Converting note names to frequencies and vice versa
- Generating and playing synthesized tones (e.g., sine waves)
- Composing melodies from note sequences
- Working with musical concepts like octaves, scales, and envelopes

Motivation
----------

Most audio libraries focus on low-level signal processing. `doremi` provides an abstraction layer
that allows musicians, researchers, and developers to interact with **musical structure** rather than raw audio buffers.

Whether you're building an educational tool, music theory analyzer, or procedural sound system, `doremi` gives you the musical building blocks.

Quick Example
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from scikitplot.experimental import _doremi as doremi
    >>> sheet = doremi.SHEET
    >>> waveform = doremi.doremi.compose_as_waveform()
    >>> file_path = doremi.save_waveform(waveform, "melody.wav")
    >>> doremi.plot_waveform(waveform, "melody.wav")


Modules
-------

- ``doremi.notes`` - Note parsing, normalization, and frequency mapping
- ``doremi.synthesis`` - Waveform generation, envelopes, and tone synthesis
- ``doremi.composer`` - High-level composition and playback tools
