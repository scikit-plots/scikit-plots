## Specify settings and behaviors for files

## Set the default behavior, in case contributors don't have core.autocrlf set.
## Line ending normalization
## Windows systems uses: "crlf" \r\n (carriage return + line feed)
## Unix-based  (like Linux and macOS) uses: "lf" \n (line feed)
## end-of-line (EOL) treated as text or binary based on its content
* text=auto eol=lf
*.md text eol=lf
*.py text eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
## Force Line Ending Normalization github-pages:
*.html text eol=lf
*.css text eol=lf
*.js text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.xml text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf

## Explicitly declare text files
*.py text
*.rst text
*.md text
*.json text
*.ipynb text
*.cfg text

## Baseline images are binary and should not be modified
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.pdf binary

## Compressed files are binary and should not be modified
*.gz binary
*.npz binary
*.zip binary


## Git LFS for large files
## specify which files should be stored in Git LFS rather than directly in the Git repository
# *.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

## Ignoring changes
## excluded from the standard Git diff output
## (e.g., when using git diff): ignore when tracking changes
# *.log   -diff

## Git not to include this file when generating an archive of the repository exports
## (e.g., when using git archive) ignored during exports
# secret.txt export-ignore

## Filtering Files
## commands that modify files during the checkout and commit processes.
# *.docx filter=custom-filter

## Custom Merge Drivers
## merge: defining how certain files should be merged during conflicts.
# *.csv merge=csv-merge-driver
# *.docx merge=word
# *.xml merge=union
# *.txt merge=union

## Attributes for Export
## export-subst: (Version: $Version$) dynamically update version information
# version: export-subst

## Git diff attributes
## how files are displayed in git diff output
# *.css diff=css

## Language-Specific Settings
## linguist-language: based on the programming language or linguistic considerations
# *.py linguist-language=Python
# *.py indent=spaces=4
# *.js linguist-language=JavaScript

## Identifying file types
# *.txt text
# *.jpg binary
