# ‚úÖ Prevents accidental direct pushes to main. Enforces review + CI.
on:
  pull_request:
  # push:
  #   branches:
  #     - main
  #     - dev
  #     - staging
  #     - release/*
  #   # branches: [main]

## simultaneity
## This ensures that only one deployment to "production" can happen at a time.
## If a new commit is pushed before the current job finishes, the in-progress job is canceled.
concurrency:
  ## Ensures that only one instance of this workflow runs per branch or PR at a time.
  ## The 'group' key defines a unique concurrency group:
  ## - github.workflow: Name of the workflow file.
  ## - github.head_ref: (Only on pull_request) The name of the branch from which the PR was created (source branch). Example: "feature/add-login"
  ## - github.run_id: (Always) A unique numeric ID for each run of a workflow. Useful as a fallback for uniqueness. Example: 6432789156
  ## - github.ref: (Always) The full ref path of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. Examples: For a push to a branch: "refs/heads/main" For a PR: "refs/pull/42/merge" For a tag: "refs/tags/v1.0.0"
  ## - github.ref_name: (Always) Just the final part of the ref path (branch or tag name, does not exist for PRs). Examples: For a push to a branch: "main" For a tag: "v1.0.0"
  ## This ensures: PRs use head_ref, Pushes/Tags use ref or ref_name, Fallback to run_id in edge cases
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref || github.run_id }}
  ## If you push multiple times quickly, older runs would continue even though newer ones have started.
  ## Canceling previous runs reduces resource usage and speeds up feedback.
  ## If a new run is triggered for the same group, cancel the in-progress one.
  cancel-in-progress: true
