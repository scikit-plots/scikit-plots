  ## Can write comments / labels on PR from fork?
  ## Use pull_request_target trigger if you're targeting a pull request from a fork:
  ## pull_request_target triggers run with the base repo code, and has write permissions.
  ## pull_request:  Safer alternative to pull_request_target:
  ## pull_request triggers run with the PR code, but no write access to secrets or repo.
  pull_request_target: # zizmor: ignore[dangerous-triggers]
    # types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, edited]  # Triggers only on these events

## simultaneity
## This ensures that only one deployment to "production" can happen at a time.
## If a new commit is pushed before the current job finishes, the in-progress job is canceled.
concurrency:
  ## Ensures that only one instance of this workflow runs per branch or PR at a time.
  ## The 'group' key defines a unique concurrency group:
  ## - github.workflow: Name of the workflow file.
  ## - github.head_ref: (Only on pull_request) The name of the branch from which the PR was created (source branch). Example: "feature/add-login"
  ## - github.run_id: (Always) A unique numeric ID for each run of a workflow. Useful as a fallback for uniqueness. Example: 6432789156
  ## - github.ref: (Always) The full ref path of the branch or tag that triggered the workflow. Examples: For a push to a branch: "refs/heads/main" For a PR: "refs/pull/42/merge" For a tag: "refs/tags/v1.0.0"
  ## - github.ref_name: (Always) Just the final part of the ref path (branch or tag name, does not exist for PRs). Examples: For a push to a branch: "main" For a tag: "v1.0.0"
  ## This ensures: PRs use head_ref, Pushes/Tags use ref or ref_name, Fallback to run_id in edge cases
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.ref || github.run_id }}
  ## If you push multiple times quickly, older runs would continue even though newer ones have started.
  ## Canceling previous runs reduces resource usage and speeds up feedback.
  ## If a new run is triggered for the same group, cancel the in-progress one.
  cancel-in-progress: true

## Top-level permissions (outside jobs)
## Job-level permissions (inside a specific job)
## Restrict the permissions granted to the use of secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN in this
## github actions workflow:
## https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication
permissions:
  ## only required for workflows in private repositories
  contents: read  # for actions/checkout to fetch code
  pull-requests: write  # Full access to read and modify PRs (e.g., labels, comments)
  issues: write   # Full access to read and modify PRs (e.g., labels, comments)

## Global environment variables (available to all jobs and steps)
## Job-level environment variables (override global, scoped to this job)
## Step-level environment variables (override job + global, scoped to this step)
