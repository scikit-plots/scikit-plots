## simultaneity
## This ensures that only one deployment to "production" can happen at a time.
## If a new commit is pushed before the current job finishes, the in-progress job is canceled.
concurrency:
  ## Ensures that only one instance of this workflow runs per branch or PR at a time.
  ## The 'group' key defines a unique concurrency group:
  ## - github.workflow: Name of the workflow file.
  ## - github.head_ref: Branch name for pull requests.
  ## - github.run_id: Fallback unique ID for other cases (like direct pushes).
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  ## If you push multiple times quickly, older runs would continue even though newer ones have started.
  ## Canceling previous runs reduces resource usage and speeds up feedback.
  ## If a new run is triggered for the same group, cancel the in-progress one.
