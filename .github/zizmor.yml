# https://docs.zizmor.sh/configuration/#discovery
# Create a file named zizmor.yml, You can put it in either:
# Location	   File Path	         Effect
# Preferred	   .github/zizmor.yml	 Only applies to workflows
# Alternative	 zizmor.yml at root	 Applies globally to repo
# ðŸš¦ After adding the file
# Just run zizmor normally. It will automatically pick up the config using local discovery.
# You don't need --config unless you want to use global discovery.

# Syntax Notes: filename.yml[:line[:column]]
# https://docs.zizmor.sh/usage/#with-zizmoryml
